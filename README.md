# Cyber-Trolling-Detection-System
Cyber_Trolling_Dataset [Final-Year-Project]

Nowadays, people increasingly use social networking sites, not only as their main source of information, but also as media
to post content, sharing their feelings and opinions. Social media is convenient, as sites allow users to reach people worldwide,
which could potentially facilitate a positive and constructive conversation between users. However, this phenomenon has a downside,
as there are more and more episodes of hate speech and harassment in online communication which resembles trolling.

This Repo Contains Datasets that we are using to train our ML model in order to indentify which comments comes under the category of Cyber Trolling.
